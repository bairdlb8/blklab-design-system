        The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications
        both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. Applied arts can include industrial design,
        graphic design, fashion design, and the decorative arts which traditionally includes craft
        objects. In graphic arts (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the
        distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art, based on the context within
        which the work is produced and how it is traded.

        To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across
        the disciplines within the applied arts and fine art. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the
        principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense
        of 'rightness'." However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will
        vary greatly.

        This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that
        design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive.
        The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. production artist,
        construction worker) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for
        what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition
        (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or
        problem-solving skills from the designer.

        "Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned above) is to the planning of
        routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are
        treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the
        industrial designing of chemical processes. With the increasing complexities of the
        information age, consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the
        design of business processes as well as manufacturing processes.
