          The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications
          both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. Applied arts can include industrial design,
          graphic design, fashion design, and the decorative arts which traditionally includes craft
          objects. In graphic arts (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration),
          the distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art, based on the context
          within which the work is produced and how it is traded.

        <p>
          To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared
          across the disciplines within the applied arts and fine art. Mark Getlein, writer,
          suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and
          part of "our sense of 'rightness'." However, the intended application and context of the
          resulting works will vary greatly.

          This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that
          design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes
          repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. production
          artist, construction worker) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to
          compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a
          simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any,
          creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned above) is to the planning of
          routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are
          treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the
          industrial designing of chemical processes. With the increasing complexities of the
          information age, consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the
          design of business processes as well as manufacturing processes.
